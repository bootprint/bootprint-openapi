## Maintainers / Contributors wanted

I'm still looking for people to help me with the bootprint project. I have found some new ambitions to make 
bootprint-openapi the greatest offline documentation generator for OpenAPI specifications. I have started, by releasing
the current version as 1.0 to show that it's time to start using {{npm 'semver'}} for versioning.

I have created a Twitter account [@bootprintjs](https://twitter.com/bootprintjs) that will now be used for announcments
and for gathering user feedback. I also plan to setup a blog.

But I might still need your help. I am, for example, certain, that there are greater designers out there than me and I
feel that some parts of bootprint-openapi need a redesign. So: 

* If you want to start maintaining the module(s), please let me know and I'll give you push access.
* I will help you by giving pointers to code-lines that need to be changed for a given feature.
* I will try to publish new versions as fast as possible.
* I might also give you publishing-rights on npm, although that seems like a large step and I would have to 
  be confident that you don't misuse it.

## Overview

This package contains a template, partials and styles for [bootprint](http://npmjs.com/bootprint) to convert
OpenAPI-Specifications into a static HTML-page.

This package was formerly known as `bootprint-swagger` and has been renamed, because 
Swagger-Specification has been renamed to OpenAPI-Specification
